            In In one of Wargaming many games "World of Tanks" we see a top tier tank destroyer known as the Object 268 version 4. This tank in a nutshell just isnt fair and is what many players call "noob friendly" as you can literally just drive and the battle field bouncing every single shell fired at you. Frontly it has only 1 weak spot that cannot be damaged easily without the use of "gold ammo". Its main gun may suck compared to others of its tier
           however however it, weights 80 tons and has a top speed of 60 kmph which makes it an excellent tank to ram in... The rest of its armour is "troll" bouncing shots off its side like no tomorrow. All in all this tank 100% needs a nerf its far too mobile and armoured to be in the game which requires some skill.

                T Thanks tank was deamed by Wargaming as "Too Powerful" for its tier and therefore removed it from sale a couple of years ago. However, this wasnt the last of the E25 as it has been put on sale numerous number of times even after Wargaming confirmed it woul never be resold due its amazing maneuverability, camo rating and rate of fire. It was known as a "stat padding" tank
                f because of its low skill cap as so many players have it. The E25 is the second most popular prenium tank(tank that has to be bought with dollah) with the infamous type 59 on top but that tank has never been resold due to its rarity and the fact Wargaming use it in competitions as so many people want it. Overall the E25 just shows that Wargaming know people love the
                f tank and would love to own it and use that to get so many people to buy one when it comes on sale.
